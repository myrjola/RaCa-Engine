RaCa-Engine - A ray casting engine.

Compiling from source:

Make sure you have JUnit4 in your classpath or the tests won't compile.

In Unix environments the command is:

find . -name *.java | xargs javac

Alternatively you can just cherry-pick files and throw them to javac.


Running the level editor:

You should be in the base directory, same as you found this README. Run the
level editor with:

java -classpath src/ leveleditor.LevelEditor
